#about the software
This bunch of software is our HTML5 Canvas and TypeScript game titled Cavator.
The game is made for our OOP-project. The objective was to make a educative game for kids around the age of 12.
We used history as our subject to make our game about.

To be able to correctly edit the game you will need to install TypeScript.
Look down a coupe of rows on how to install TypeScript.

#installing TypeScript
1. Clone this repository to your pc
2. Make sure you have [NodeJS](https://nodejs.org/en/download/) installed (preferably the LTS version). This will also install `npm`.
3. Open a terminal window (command prompt, git bash, powershell)
4. Check if NodeJS is installed by typing `node --version` into the terminal. It should print a line with something like `v8.12.0`.
5. Check if NPM is installed by typing  `npm --version` into the terminal. It should print a line with something like `6.4.1`.
6. As an alternative to NPM, you could use the [Yarn](yarnpkg.com) npm client from Google and Facebook (it works slightly better and faster than NPM). Install by running `npm install -g yarn`
7. Install de dependencies by running `npm install` or `yarn install` from the project directory.
8. Compile the project by running `npm run build` or `yarn run build`. If you want to run the build script everytime you make changes automatically, you can use `npm run watch` or `yarn run watch`. To check out how this works, you can open the `package.json`.
9. Open the `tsconfig.json` file in this project.
10. Search the [TypeScript documentation](https://www.typescriptlang.org/docs/home.html) and try to explain every line in the json file. Don't understand something? That's fine! Just don't copy stuff for the sake of filling up your answers.
